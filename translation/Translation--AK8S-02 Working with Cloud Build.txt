AK8S-02 Working with Cloud Build

Objectives
In this lab, you learn how to perform the following tasks:
Use Cloud Build to build and push containers
Use Container Registry to store and deploy containers

Task 1: In GCP console, on the top right toolbar, click the Open Cloud Shell button.


 1.To Enable cloud-build APIs run:
		gcloud services enable cloud-build
	To enable Container-Registry APIS run:
		gcloud services enable Container-Registry

2. Create an empty quickstart.sh file using the nano text editor.
		nano quickstart.sh

3. Add the following lines in to the quickstart.sh file: and Save the file and close nano by pressing the CTRL+X key, then press Y and enter.
		#!/bin/sh
		echo "Hello, world! The time is $(date)."

3. Create an empty Dockerfile file using the nano text editor.
		nano Dockerfile

4.  Add the following Dockerfile command: (This instructs the build to use the Alpine Linux base image.)
    Add the following Dockerfile command to the end of the Dockerfile: (This adds the quickstart.sh script to the / directory in the image.)
    Add the following Dockerfile command to the end of the Dockerfile:
		FROM alpine
		COPY quickstart.sh /
		CMD ["/quickstart.sh"]

5. Save the file and close nano by pressing the CTRL+X key, then press Y and enter.

6. Run the following command to make the quickstart.sh script executable.
		chmod +x quickstart.sh
7. run the following command to build the Docker container image in Cloud Build.
		gcloud builds submit --tag gcr.io/${GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT}/quickstart-image .
8.  When the build completes, comfirm your Docker image is built and pushed to Container Registry.

9.   enter the following command to clone the repository to the lab Cloud Shell.
		git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatformTraining/training-data-analyst
10.  Change to the directory that contains the sample files for this lab.
		cd ~/training-data-analyst/courses/ak8s/02_Cloud_Build/a
11.  execute the following command to view the contents of cloudbuild.yaml.
		cat cloudbuild.yaml
12.  execute the following command to start a Cloud Build using cloudbuild.yaml as the build configuration file:
		gcloud builds submit --config cloudbuild.yaml .

Task 3. Building and Testing Containers with a build configuration file and Cloud Build

13. change to the directory that contains the sample files for this lab.
		cd ~/training-data-analyst/courses/ak8s/02_Cloud_Build/b

14.  execute the following command to view the contents of cloudbuild.yaml.
		cat cloudbuild.yaml
15.  execute the following command to start a Cloud Build using cloudbuild.yaml as the build configuration file:
		gcloud builds submit --config cloudbuild.yaml .
16.  Confirm that your command shell knows that the build failed:
		echo $?
